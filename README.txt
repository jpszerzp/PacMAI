Intent of Code
The main file subject to modification is the multiAgents.py in this case, which simulate multiple agents in Pacman with different AI algorithm.
In this project I implemented three approaches: Minimax, alpha-beta pruning optimization, and Expectimax. 
I also implemented the simple Manhattan distance evaluation function. 

Code doc
multiAgents.py -
Class that runs multiple agents of a round of Pacman game on some layout. 
The class support adversarial algorithms in interest, and test their effectiveness in game.

User guide
•Navigate to correct directory (the one with layouts and test_cases folder)
•In the terminal run auto grader with command “python autograder.py”
•Observe the result of q5
•Disclosure: I only used code that affects q5, mainly for purpose of testing (q1 to q5 is officially invented by the faculty of the course at Berkeley). 
The multiAgent.py file alone satisfies my intention of implementing the targeted adversarial algorithms.
